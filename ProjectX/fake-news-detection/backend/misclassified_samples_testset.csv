that they know the russian attacked the un aid convoy passing through a rebel terroristheld highway while travelling out of west aleppo and heading southwest towards alfoua and kefraya villages from the onset both russian and syrian military stated they were not involved in this incident but us maintain they are the guilty parties john kerry blaming russia for mysterious attack on un convoythe us insistence to blame russia for attacking this un aid convoy appears to be a desperate deflectanddivert public relations move to mask the fact the washington destroyed its own ceasefire agreement on saturday when it massacred over 70 syrian army soldiers and wounding another 100 in a sustained one hourlong attack involving multiple aircraft from the us uk australia and denmark because of that usled airstrike isis was allowed to advance immediately forward towards taking the key strategic city of deir alzour in spite of the unlikely coincidence washington claimed this was all just a mistake in addition us coalition and gulfbacked rebel terrorists had already broke the russiaus ceasefire multiple times and are also on record boasting earlier in the week how terroristheld east aleppo militants would refuse any un aid convoy that crossed their sightsdid the us and its rebel forces on the ground orchestrate another false flag event designed to avoid condemnation of saturday s massacre our western colleages are putting their best efforts to hype up the situation and blur the tragedy in deir ezzor and to distract the international community from alnusra s advance on aleppo and thus cover the us incompetence in distinguishing between the moderate opposition and terrorists in syria russian spokepersonnow new evidence suggests that the us coalition may be misleading the world about their true intentions rtthe russian defense ministry says that a us coalition drone was in the vicinity of a humanitarian convoy when it was attacked outside aleppo according to the russian military the unmanned aircraft was a predator drone on the evening of september 19 in that specific region a drone belonging to the international condition which had taken off from the incirlik air base in turkey was flying at a height of 3600 meters and traveling at around 200 kilometers per hour said russian defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov the object was in the area around the town of urm alkubra where the convoy was a few minutes before it caught fire konashenkov added it left after about 30 minutes the defense ministry spokesman said he wanted to point out that as was the case with the tragedy on september 17 which saw usled coalition airstrike kill and injure 200 people the russians would not be making any unfounded allegations only the owners know what exactly the drone was doing at this particular area at that exact time he addedmoscow says it has provided all the data it possesses regarding the attack on the convoy which was carrying aid to rebelheld areas in aleppo russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said at a un security council meeting on wednesday there was another unacceptable provocation on september 19 the shelling of a humanitarian convoy near aleppo he said i am confident that such coincidences require serious analysis and an investigation on september 19 a humanitarian convoy consisting of 31 trucks was attacked while heading to aleppo according to the red cross 20 civilians and one aid worker died as a result initial reports claimed the convoy had been targeted by an airstrike later the un said all it could confirm was that the convoy was attackedon tuesday the russian defense ministry reiterated that neither it nor the syrian military had launched airstrikes on the convoy russian and syrian warplanes did not carry out any airstrikes on a un humanitarian aid convoy in the southwest of aleppo konashenkov said in a statement he added that the military had studied video footage of the convoy which appeared to rule out that an airstrike took place we have closely studied the video footage from where the incident took place and we did not find any signs of any ammunition having hit the convoy there are no craters while the vehicles have their chassis intact and they have not been severely damaged which would have been the case from an airstrike konashenkov said all of the video footage demonstrates that the convoy caught fire which strangely happened almost at exactly at the same time as militants started a largescale offensive on aleppo in a statement konashenkov said moscow was compelled to disclose the sensitive details in response to the accusations made by us deputy national security adviser ben rhodes who has laid the blame for the attack on the aid convoy on russia this type of drone can not only monitor the situation but also guide ground weapons to their targets and inflict surgical airstrikes at objects located on the ground by itself the russian spokesman

trump knows the art of the deal like no one else he d had enough of donothing paul ryan so he went around him and made a better deal with democrats that actually helps the hurricane victims the three month deal was much better than the commitment of 18 months that speaker ryan had proposed president trump shocked and angered republicans on wednesday by agreeing with democrats on a bill to suspend the debt ceiling for three months but by thursday republican lawmakers and aides were acknowledging that trump s plan was better for republicans than the plan put forward by house speaker paul ryan rwismany republicans weren t all that happy with either proposal ryan was proposing an 18month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stabilitybut democrats said they could only agree to a threemonth suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks trump s decision to take the democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of republicans and a sign trump was abandoning the gop on a key legislative packageafter the dust settled however republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the threemonth plan as a slight improvement over ryan s planthe reason was simpleneither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing something many conservatives wanted to see with that key piece lacking many republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason democrats did it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription in this case spending cutsa source with the conservative house freedom caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that trump settled on wednesday but this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts lots of members think the threemonth deal is bad but so is an 18month deal this source said but the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon and in that way is better for republicans hfc members don t want to sit on their hands the source saidhfc members in particular see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included when the battle heats up again the hfc is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of us gross domestic productthe hfc is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with house gop leaders the republican study committee in contrast is more mainstream and is comprised of most house gop lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policiesbut even the rsc indicated wednesday that trump s deal is better for republicans than what ryan was pushing for example rsc member tom cole rokla said wednesday that he preferred trump s plan over ryan s i think a shortterm deal is much easier to vote for than an 18month or twoyear extension with no offsets he said on msnbc describing the choices that were put before the gop cole cast the deal trump reached as a slight delay that will let republicans try again soon for spending cuts i think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts he added so we live to fight another day for entire story washington examiner,1,ISOT_FAKE,,0,0.3303693359288396,0.6696306640711605

donald trump has been fundraising like crazy for his reelection campaign having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term but there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds according to reuters he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the russia scandalreuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters but up until now the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issuestrump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters one of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money that helps to give trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense furthermore since the russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors dollars on russiahis campaign organization currently has nearly 12 million when reuters asked trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid he snapped that s none of your business trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the 2016 election cycle and has been spending government money at some of those same properties lining his pockets with public dollars his campaign has paid one law firm jones day almost 4 million some of which probably did go to help with the russia probe jones day has also responded to inquiries related to russia including sending documents to congress on the campaign s behalfhere s the sad thing his donors whether they know where their money is going or not would probably cheer their chance to help trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the russia probe they think they re helping him get reelected in 2020 so they think they re helping him defeat the great deepstate witch huntfeatured image via drew angerergetty images,1,ISOT_FAKE,,0,0.366189270291804,0.6338107297081961

missoula mont reuters montana republican congressional candidate greg gianforte was cited for a misdemeanor on wednesday after a reporter accused him of physical assault on the eve of a special election to fill the states lone seat in the us house of representatives the gallatin county sheriffs office issued the citation for misdemeanor assault hours after ben jacobs a political correspondent for the us edition of the guardian newspaper said in a twitter post and in a television interview that gianforte body slammed him breaking his eyeglasses the incident which caps a campaign seen as a possible bellwether for next years midterm congressional races took place at an event in bozeman where jacobs sought to question gianforte about healthcare according to an audio tape captured by jacobs and played on cable television networks msnbc and cnn fox news channel reporter alicia acuna who said she and her crew were in the room preparing to interview gianforte wrote that she saw gianforte as he grabbed jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground acuna her field producer and photographer then watched in disbelief as gianforte began punching jacobs as he moved to top of the reporter gianfortes campaign did not deny jacobs allegation but countered in its own statement that jacobs instigated an altercation by barging into the candidates office shoved a recording device in his face and began asking badgering questions after asking jacobs to lower the recorder jacobs declined campaign spokesman shane scanlon wrote greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face jacobs grabbed gregs wrist and spun away from greg pushing them both to the ground its unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer bbq the statement said acuna disputed that jacobs was the aggressor at no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward gianforte acuna wrote in her account on the fox news website interviewed later on msnbc jacobs said he retreated to a parking lot after the confrontation to call his editor and the police he said he was speaking to msnbc from a hospital where he was getting his elbow xrayed the citation was issued after authorities conducted several interviews and investigated the incident sheriff brian gootkin said in a statement gianforte has until june 7 to appear in a county court he faces a 500 fine and six months in jail if convicted according to gootkin the nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault gootkin said in jacobs audio tape of the incident gianforte is heard shouting im sick and tired of you guys the last guy who came here you did the same thing after loud scuffling noises are heard gianforte repeatedly yells get the hell out of here jacobs is heard saying you just bodyslammed me and broke my glasses according to the tape the confrontation began as jacobs tried to ask gianforte if he supported a republican healthcare overhaul bill after the congressional budget office found the measure would cost 23 million americans their medical insurance coverage by 2026 another reporter alexis levinson of buzzfeed news who was just outside the office said on twitter she saw jacobs feet fly in the air as he hit the floor amid yelling and commotion gianforte later huddled behind closed doors with an aide before leaving the event by car she said tech executive gianforte is running against democrat rob quist a banjoplaying political novice who hopes to pull off a surprise victory in the republicanleaning state a victory for quist could signal trouble ahead for president donald trump and his fellow republicans as they defend their 24seat house majority in the 2018 midterm elections quist and gianforte are vying for the seat vacated when trump who carried montana by more than 20 percentage points named ryan zinke as us interior secretary republicans have held the seat for two decades and gianforte was still the favorite however both sides say the race was tightening as quist focused on criticism of republican efforts to repeal and replace former democratic president barack obamas signature healthcare law the affordable care act known as obamacare,0,ISOT_REAL,,1,0.6064764640781822,0.6064764640781822

21st century wire says washington s muscle flexing seems to have taken on a life of its own as the shadow of us neocolonialism falls over much of the world with increasing intensity in syria the us is lashing out lawlessly at the bastion of resistance that has been denying its objectives for almost seven years now the us secretary of state rex tillerson has declared that china should exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on north korea to step away from its nuclear and missile programmes footage of a reported massive live fire drill conducted by the north koreans in april 2017 gives some indication of what the us might face if this escalation is magnified beyond recall by the usual suspects at fox news and cnn this report is from peter symonds of wswsin what amounted to a barely disguised threat us secretary of state rex tillerson yesterday declared that china had to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on north korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs if it wants to prevent a further escalation in the region in other words if beijing fails to rein in the pyongyang regime the us could resort to military measurestillerson s remarks followed a toplevel meeting in washington between him and us defence secretary james mattis and their chinese counterparts china s foreign policy chief yang jiechi and general fang fenghui chief of the people s liberation army s joint staff departmenttillerson called on china to make greater efforts to halt illicit revenue streams to north korea that allegedly help fund pyongyang s military programs just last week he told a congressional committee the trump administration was at a stage where we are going to have to start taking secondary sanctions that is penalise countries and corporations that engage in economic activities with north koreaunilateral secondary sanctions imposed by the us would above all fall on chinese companies china is by far north korea s largest trading partner us officials and the media have repeatedly accused beijing of failing to do enough to choke off trade and finance with the pyongyang regime any penalties against chinese individuals or entities would quickly sour relations between the us and chinajust before the talks us president donald trump signalled that time was running out for china to force north korea to bow to us demands while i greatly appreciate the efforts of president xi jinping and china he tweeted on tuesday it has not worked out while tillerson s remarks indicate the us continues to pressure china for action against north korea trump s tweet is a warning that the us will resort to other measures including military action if there are no resultsasked about trump s tweet defence secretary mattis told the joint press conference with tillerson what you re seeing i think is the american people s frustration with a regime that provokes and provokes and provokes and basically plays outside the rules plays fast and loose with the truth mattis denounced pyongyang in particular for the death of otto wambier the american student imprisoned in north korea who died on monday after being flown back to the us last week the trump administration is considering a ban to prevent americans from visiting pyongyang three other us citizens are currently jailed in north koreathe comments of mattis and tillerson suggest that relations with china could deteriorate rapidly especially if north korea conducts another nuclear test or a longrange missile launch in comments to cnn unnamed us officials claimed this week that satellite imagery showed new activity at north korea s underground nuclear test site and suggested that a sixth nuclear detonation could be imminentahead of yesterday s talks in washington us state department officials indicated that mattis and tillerson would press their chinese counterparts not only on north korea but a range of other sensitive issues including the south china sea and the socalled war on terrorismacting assistant secretary of state for east asia susan thornton told voice of america that all parties should freeze any construction or militarisation of features in the south china sea a comment directed especially at china last month the us navy carried out another provocative freedom of navigation operation sending a guided missile destroyer within the 12nauticalmile territorial limit claimed by china around one of its isletstrade and economic issues were excluded from yesterday s uschina diplomatic and security dialogue but remained just below the surface during last year s presidential election campaign trump repeatedly denounced china s trade policies and threatened punitive trade war measures in seeking beijing s assistance to pressure pyongyang trump suggested the us could make concessions on tradehaving tweeted that chinese efforts have not worked out the implicit threat is that the us could ramp up the pressure on china over trade what trump is saying is i don t need you on north korea now and therefore maybe we should have it out on these other issues like trade analyst john delury told the new york timeschina is reluctant to impose new sanctions that will cripple north korea s economy and provoke a political crisis that could be exploited by the us and its allies at yesterday s talks chinese officials reiterated beijing s call for renewed negotiations based on a freeze by pyongyang on its nuclear and missile tests and a freeze by washington on its joint military exercises in south korea the us has flatly rejected the proposalabove all the threat of us military strikes against north korea hangs over asia earlier this week the pentagon again sent two b1 strategic bombers on a mission over the korean peninsula in a provocative show of force the us navy has two aircraft carrier strike groups stationed in the area with another on its wayany us military action against north korea threatens to trigger an allout conflict on the korean peninsula that could draw in other powers including china with devastating consequences the trump administration s recklessness is underscored by the fact that it is engaged in an escalating confrontation in syria that threatens to provoke a clash with russia and iran even as it is ramping up tensions in north east asiafor more information on north korea

reuters former fbi director james comey on thursday accused the trump administration of defaming him but declined to offer his opinion on whether president donald trump sought to obstruct justice by asking him to drop an investigation into the former national security advisor the hearing could have significant repercussions for trumps presidency as special counsel robert mueller and several congressional committees investigate alleged russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and whether trumps campaign colluded with this comey said trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a great job comey said administration chose to defame him and fbi by saying organization was in disarray comey said those were lies plain and simple comey said he has no doubt russia interfered with us election comey says he is confident no votes cast in 2016 election were altered comey says it is not for him to say whether trump tried to obstruct justice in their conversations comey says found conversations with trump very disturbing comey says trump did not ask him to stop russia investigation comey says fbi became aware of russia cyber intrusion in late summer of 2015 scott wren senior global equity strategist wells fargo investment institute st louis missouri from the statement released yesterday just from the headlines it sounded like it was pretty benign so the action in the market not just so far today but in general over the last couple of months is the market certainly doesnt think theres going to be much that comes out of this and i think largely thats because if there was something thats going to come out as leaky as things seem to be we would have heard something more than what weve been hearing so far so i think the market thinks thats the likely outcome john canavan market strategist stone mccarthy research associates princeton new jersey he didnt offer that much that was new he confirmed all the previously reported concerns concerns about the interactions between comey and trump remain there was a very muted market response it leaves us where we were before it becomes that much more difficult for the trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected you are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018 possibly in 2019 a lot of the initial euphoria for strong fiscal stimulus has already been unwound primarily in the bond market even without fiscal stimulus the economy would be able to maintain its current momentum we are looking for steady growth next year in our view this would allow the fed to raise next week and likely one more time this year either in september or in december dan scavino jr white house director of social media on verified twitter account sorry dems nothing here no votes were altered by russians in the 2016 election potus or team never asked to stop election investigation art hogan chief market strategist at wunderlich securities in new york to the extent it doesnt seem to be a gottcha moment here the markets plodding along unless something comes out thats outside the realm of the expected thats what we should expect i wouldnt say the markets taking action either way here the market looked at this as one of three major events today along with this youve got the ecb and the uk election its a pretty catalyst filled day it feels like comey is pretty good at staying in the middle of the fairway in his responses if they havent been able to tease anything out of him in the first two hours theyre probably not going to get more i think the market is looking at this as a nonmarket moving event much like the ecb meeting was thomas simons money market economist jeffries co new york the testimony doesnt appear to be super substantive my read on the prepared remarks yesterday was that there was nothing particularly stirring there i think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here that there has been any illegal activity by highranking officials so its not particularly impactful for thinking about the impact for trumps economic agenda to go through or anything like that jon adams senior investment strategist and portfolio manager at bmo global asset management in chicago we would need to see more evidence as far as explicit direction from the president for there to be a more significant market reaction weve been worried about complacency in the market around political risk as investors have become immune to the daily noise out of washington we ask does this impact economic growth or earnings growth and so far the answer is no to both of those questions omer esiner chief market analyst at commonwealth foreign exchange in washington so far we havent had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released the dollaryen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from james comey that we did not already know we are not likely to get any new revelation that suggests that the presidents behavior was anything other than maybe inappropriate and certainly likely fell short of the bar for obstruction of justice outside of a little bit of a move higher in dollaryen theres really not much that is going on stephen massocca senior vice president at wedbush securities in san francisco its the james comey show nobody cares none of this is going to matter the republicans are going to say there is nothing to see here move along there is no there there in my opinion which is why stocks arent reacting at best what we have here is a president who has zero political experience probably said something he shouldnt have said i dont see it becoming a bigger issue i dont think this is going to move any needle in any direction its not significant enough that the republicans are going to bail on trump and the democrats are going to make a lot of noise about it but at the end of the day people care about unemployment job growth and more important issues than this in my opinion bucky hellwig senior vice president at bbt wealth management in birmingham alabama the hearings should be mostly a nonevent for stocks unless there is some kind of unforeseen smoking gun either way detrimental to the president or beneficial to him because the president did not invoke executive privilege it raises the likelihood that nothing happens during the hearings ie there is nothing secret or detrimental to keep out of the hearings separately it looks like the market is looking for excuses to go higher as it dances around alltime highs earnings are rising rates are falling supporting higher pes and the technical indicators show the market in an uptrend so if the hearings maintain the status quo it could move money off the sidelines into stocks tom di galoma managing director seaport global holdings new york at the end of the day former fbi director comey hasnt really revealed anything new in my view so bond prices are either treading water to heading lower donald trump jr son of us president donald trump on verified twitter account hoping and telling are two very different things you would think that a guy like comey would know that givemeabreak faiza patel codirector liberty national security program at the brennan center for justice in new york city comeys notes will be very useful for mueller they are detailed close in time notes so will carry weight even potentially legal weight they were made before comey was fired and so he had no grudge against trump when he wrote them alan dershowitz professor emeritus harvard law school cambridge ma nothing ive heard so far changes my view that the president did not obstruct justice laura donohue georgetown university law center professor of law washington dc if the president directed comey to drop the investigation with an improper purpose then it is a violation of the law tim kaine democratic us senator from virginia on verified twitter account trump and his team brought their own cloud in with them its not the investigation thats the cloud its their own actions comeyday terry sandven chief equity strategist at us bank wealth management in minneapolis today is about washington and the drama surrounding former fbi director james comeys testimony and the talk about the demise of president trumps presidency or growth agenda seems premature short of a smoking gun i think after todays testimony focus will quickly shift back to his progrowth agenda mainly less regulation tax reform healthcare reform and infrastructure spending but clearly all eyes are on washington and i expect equities to generally trend sideways today short of any new revelations coming out of the testimony stocks stocks were little changed as comeys testimony kicked off trading slightly lowertoflat then moved slightly ahead bonds us treasury prices were lower ahead of comeys testimony and pared losses as he testified forex the dollar strengthened against a basket of
